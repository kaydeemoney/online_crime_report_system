            <ul>
                <li>Cybercrime: Including phishing scams, hacking attempts, identity theft, and online fraud.</li>
                <li>Fraudulent Activities: Reports on financial scams, deceptive practices, and fraudulent schemes.</li>
                <li>Other Online Offenses: Any suspicious or criminal activities encountered online that threaten personal or public safety.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>

            <p>Reporting an incident through our system is straightforward and confidential.
